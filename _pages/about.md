Hi! My name is Hainiu Xu. I am a first year PhD student at King's College Londond studying Natural Language Processing (NLP) under the supervision of Professor [Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe/home?authuser=0). Before KCL, I was a Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Data Science, where I did research in NLP mentored by Professor [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/index.html). I obtained Bachelor's degree at the University of California, Davis with a major in Statistical Data Science. During my undergraduate study, I worked extensively with Professor [Jane-Ling Wang](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~wang/aboutme.html) on functional data analysis (FDA).

My research interest primarily lies in _Machine Reasoning_ and _Narrative Understanding_. My goal is to help machines to understand and reason about events with personalities. 

I can be best reached by email. Please feel free to contact me about my research or to inquire for potential collaboration. I am also happy to take questions about PhD application and doing research in NLP.
